## Hi, Iâ€™m Mateus! It's nice to see you here.

I've worked in many different departments: Marketing, Operations, User Support, Project Management and CRM! But I always liked working with data, Analyzing and seeing what they have to tell me and also and why not, tell a story with them, And here I am, looking to use the data to discover the mysteries of the universe!!

### In the last months I've been working a lot with Power Bi,  Google Data Studio, Google Colab, MySql and Python.
